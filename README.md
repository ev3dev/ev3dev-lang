ev3dev language bindings
========================

This repository provides several language bindings for the sensor, motor, and other functionality in the [ev3dev](http://www.ev3dev.org) Linux distribution for the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 hardware.

We currently have libraries for the following languages here:
- C++
- Lua
- Node.JS
- Vala

Each binding complies with our universal language binding specification, which also serves as high-level documentation for our wrappers.
